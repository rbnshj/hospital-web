            City Hospital, nestled in the heart of Ernakulam, was founded in 1971 by a group of distinguished and experienced doctors. It quickly earned a reputation for pioneering services, notably being the first hospital in the region to offer 24-hour Casualty care. Over the years, it became a leading multispecialty institution, renowned for its exceptional medical team, which included some of the most esteemed doctors in the field. The hospital prided itself on delivering a comprehensive range of healthcare services with a personal touch, making it a trusted choice for patients seeking quality medical care.

            In July 2011, a new chapter began for City Hospital when Mr. Basheeruddin, a visionary technocrat and Managing Director of Furnace Fabrica—a Mumbai-based company specializing in the supply and erection of industrial plants and equipment globally—acquired the majority shares of the hospital. Together with a group of his well-wishers, he set out to breathe new life into the institution. Their shared vision was to rejuvenate City Hospital, restoring it to its former glory, and to redefine its mission with a renewed emphasis on providing high-quality medical care.
